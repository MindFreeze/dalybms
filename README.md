# HA Addon for Daly Smart BMS
Home assistant addon that monitors a Daly Smart BMS through UART USB and publishes the data to MQTT. Has MQTT discovery build in, so no need to add the sensors manually to HA.

Based on the protocol docs found here https://github.com/jblance/mpp-solar/blob/master/docs/protocols/DALY-Daly_RS485_UART_Protocol.pdf and the discussion here https://diysolarforum.com/threads/decoding-the-daly-smartbms-protocol.21898/


The main code is in monitor.py, if you want to expand or change it.

## Install

Add https://github.com/MindFreeze/home-assistant-addons to the addon store repositories and you will get a Daly Smart BMS listed there.
Note that this assumes the BMS is /dev/ttyUSB0. If you have other USB to Serial devices connected this might be wrong.

## Energy and power

You can do this easily. For power in `W`, just create a template sensor and multiply `current * voltage`. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/template/

Then to get `kWh` for energy you can create an integration sensor from the power sensor. https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/integration/
